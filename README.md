# LEDSimulator

This is a WIP LED simulator designed by Jackson Angerdina of FRC Team 2992.
The simulator is designed to replicate Adafruit Neopixel libraries for a computer setting. This allows for easy testing without a test bench or robot. Functions are designed to replicate those seen on an arduino. A basic GUI is included.
Note that this is only a simulator and therefore, I don't expect it to be 100% accurate. This is more of a functionality tester, to ensure that the code is doing what you want it to do before it goes on a robot, as well as to minimize the time that is taken away from other important build season tasks.
